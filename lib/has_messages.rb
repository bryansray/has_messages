    module MacroMethods
      # Creates the following message associations:
      # * +messages+ - Messages that were composed and are visible to the owner.  Mesages may have been sent or unsent.
      # * +received_messages - Messages that have been received from others and are visible.  Messages may have been read or unread.
      # 
      # == Creating new messages
      # 
      # To create a new message, the +messages+ association should be used, for example:
      # 
      #   user = User.find(123)
      #   message = user.messages.build
      #   message.subject = 'Hello'
      #   message.body = 'How are you?'
      #   message.to User.find(456)
      #   message.save!
      #   message.deliver!
      # 
      # == Drafts
      # 
      # You can get the drafts for a particular user by using the +unsent_messages+
      # helper method.  This will find all messages in the "unsent" state.  For example,
      # 
      #   user = User.find(123)
      #   user.unsent_messages
      # 
      # You can also get at the messages that *have* been sent, using the +sent_messages+
      # helper method.  For example,
      # 
      #  user = User.find(123)
      #  user.sent_messages
