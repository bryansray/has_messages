# Represents a message sent from one user to one or more others.
# 
# == States
# 
# Messages can be in 1 of 3 states:
# * +unsent+ - The message has not yet been sent.  This is the *initial* state.
# * +queued+ - The message has been queued for future delivery.
# * +sent+ - The message has been sent.
# 
# == Interacting with the message
# 
# In order to perform actions on the message, such as queueing or delivering,
# you should always use the associated event action:
# * +queue!+ - Queues the message so that you can send it in a separate process
# * +deliver!+ - Sends the message to all of the recipients
# 
# == Hiding messages
# 
# Although you can delete a message, it will also delete it from the inbox of all
# the message's recipients.  Instead, you can hide messages from users with the
# following actions:
# * +hide!+ -Hides the message from the sender's inbox
# * +unhide!+ - Makes the message visible again
